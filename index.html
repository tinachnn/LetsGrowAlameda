      <h2>EASY. FUN. ACCESSIBLE.</h2>
      <p> Letâ€™s Grow! Alameda is a community-based initiative that promotes gardening and composting during
        the current public health crisis. Coronavirus has impacted many people in different ways: unemployment,
        cancellation of major events, quarantine, and mental health. Studies demonstrate that young people bear
        a disproportionate burden of mental health difficulties, including stress and anxiety. Gardening has long
        been considered therapeutic for those struggling with mental health, thus offering a solution to this
        serious problem. Many schools across Alameda have gardens and incorporate them into their curriculum
        as an immersive, interactive experience that helps learn about scientific topics. However, such gardens
        cannot be utilized during quarantine, so the environmental and health benefits associated with gardening
        are lost. We hope to encourage composting and gardening during this new era, especially amongst younger
        students, such as those in elementary and middle schools. </p>
